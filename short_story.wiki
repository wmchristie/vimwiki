I don't know how I ended up here. 

I remember all of the events but have no idea how those events could result in where I
am now. I don't have time to be writing, but if I don't get a handle on what's happening I will probably die,
so I'm writing it all down to see what I can discover. I'll start at the point that appears to be the beginning of the
relevant chain of events.

So, there I was buck naked and covered in bacon grease with an alternator under one arm and a dwelf hairless cat under
the other. Just kidding. Sorry. I love that joke.

Stop screwing around, Jack. 

Ok, this writing thing is going to work better if I pretend that I'm talking to someone, so I'm going to pretend to
be narrating to a future reader.

I'm Jack. I'm in trouble. I think the trouble started three days ago at 11:17 AM.
