== How to Update controller software ==
ssh into the controller server

```cd ~/docker/unifi
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

== Move or Redefine a Device ==
Always `forget` a device before executing `set-default` on the device.

Make sure the `Gateway IP` is correct in the default network in the controller software. It should point to the IP of
the USG.

=== Connect USG to ATT ===
Att assigns `192.168.1.1` to the USG after the USG has been reset to factory defaults. Change that IP to 10.0.0.1,
or your preference, as the first step. If you don't the USG will not be able to see the internet.

=== Inform ===
The `inform` url must be an IP address, not a domain name; give the controller server a static IP when you are done.
Sample: `http://10.0.0.8:8080/inform`

==== Network Application settings ====
Set `Network application Hostname/IP` to the IP of the server that's running the controller, i.e., `10.0.0.6`.
Enable `Override inform host with the Network application hostname/IP.`
Save.

Changing these values will probably cause all of your devices to get hoarked and require setting to factory defaults
and begin the Chain of Frustration(TM).

== ATT ==
The Att router can provide wifi. It's IP is 192.168.1.254. The password is in 1Password.
The `IP Passthrough` settings are under `Firewall`.
